# ESPM in Cloud Foundry

The ESPM (Enterprise Sales & Procurement Model) application is a reference application which demonstrates how to build applications on SAP Cloud Platform (CF) with the Java runtime. This project mainly focuses on the migration of the [SAP Cloud Platform (NEO) application](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-espm-v2) to the SAP Cloud Platform (Cloud Foundry).

# Description

ESPM application has 2 underlying applications
- webshop: this application is a webshopping app, which does have any authentication
- retailer: this application is used by a retailer to manage stocks, approve/reject sales orders. We use authentication here

For more details about the project, please refer to https://github.com/SAP/cloud-espm-v2 

# Requirements

- [Java8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [CF CLI](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/4ef907afb1254e8286882a2bdef0edf4.html)
- If you do not yet have a Cloud Foundry environment trial or enterprise account, signup for a Cloud Foundry environment trial account by following the [documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/76e79d62fa0149d5aa7b0698c9a33687.html)
- To deploy the MTAR we need the MTA CF CLI plugin, download the MTA CF CLI Plugin from [here](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud)

# Download and Installation

### Running the application

**Note:** If you wish to deploy the application using MTAR, then directly skip to the section [Building MTAR](#building-mtar)

#### 1. Login to Cloud Foundry

```
cf api <api>
cf login -o <org> -s <space>
```

#### 2. Create Service

Depending on the requirement, create a service instance for either of the database (HANA or PostgreSQL).

```
cf create-service hana schema espm-hana (HANA)
or
cf create-service postgresql v9.4-dev espm-postgres (PostgreSQL)
```

Create service instance for the XSUAA 

```
cf cs xsuaa default espm-uaa -c xs-security.json
```

#### 3. Edit Manifest

Open the manifest.yml file and edit the following
Replace <i-number> placeholders with your ```I/D/C numbers``` so that the application name and host name is unique in the CF landscape.

```DATABASE_TYPE: <DB name>```

Replace the ```<DB name>``` with the Database name for which you have created the service instance

For HANA – ```hana```

For PostgreSQL – ```postgresql```

```<DB instance name>```

Replace the <DB instance name> with the service instance that you have created for the database.

#### 4. Build the application

Maven build the java application to package into a war file

Go to java/ folder and execute ```mvn clean install```


```
Note: When running the application in internet, follow the below steps to download the ngdbc driver to your local ~.m2 repository, as its not available in central maven

1. You need to download the SAP Hana Cloud Platform SDK from here: https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud
2. Take the latest "Java Web Tomcat 8" from the download section (a package starting with neo-).
3. Unzip the archive to an arbitrary location on your devbox.
4. Extract the JDBC driver (ngdbc.jar) from the archive (you will find the driver in the archive under: repository/.archive/lib/ngdbc.jar). The driver is closed source, so it is NOT available from public Maven repositories!
5. Put the driver either to your local maven repository with:
**mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-file> -DgroupId=com.sap.db \**
    **-DartifactId=ngdbc -Dversion=2.0.13 -Dpackaging=jar**

``` 

#### 5. Install Dependencies

Go to web/retailer and execute ```npm install```

Go to web/webshop and execute ```npm install```

Make sure you have npm registry = "https://npm.sap.com/"

To setup the registry locally for each command, use the following

```npm install --registry=https://npm.sap.com/ -proxy=null```

#### 6. Push the application

```cf push -f manifest.yml```


#### 7. Setup Role collections

We need to setup the Role collections for the UAA, since the Retailer application needs the template role called "Retailer" assigned to the user, for the application to work.

 - In your trial account, in the left pane select Role collections under the Security tab.

 - Add a new Role collection named, "Retailer"

 - Click on the newly created "Retailer "role collection and add new Role.

 - Select the application identifier name similar to the one you have given in the xs-security.json file.

 - Select the role template and assign the Role you have created in the previous step.

#### 8. Assign Role to the user

We need to assign the role which we have created in the previous step to the user.

 - In your trial account, in the left pane select "Trust Configuration" under the Security tab.

 - Click on the default IDP service.

 - Enter username/email and click on the add Assignment button.

 - Select the Role as "Retailer" to assign it to the user.

# Security Implementation

![Security Diagram](/docs/images/ui-merge.jpg?raw=true)

Approuter has been binded to the XSUAA service.

Authentication Method specified in the xs-app.json file with

- Webshop - AuthenticationType: None

- Retailer - AuthenticationType: XSUAA

# Securing the Backend Application

To Secure the backend application, we need to bind the XSUAA service to the backend.

![Backend Security Diagram](/docs/images/ui-merge-backend-uaa.jpg?raw=true)

[spring-security.xml](/espm-cloud-web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring-security.xml) has been implemented to intercept the url based on the specified scopes.

1. Uncomment the xs2security dependency from the [java/espm-cloud-web/pom.xml](/java/espm-cloud-web/pom.xml)

```
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.sap.xs2.security</groupId>
      <artifactId>java-container-security</artifactId>
      <version>0.24.3</version>
      <scope>compile</scope>
   </dependency>
```

And also from [java/pom.xml](/java/pom.xml)

```
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.sap.xs2.security</groupId>
      <artifactId>java-container-security</artifactId>
      <version>0.24.3</version>
   </dependency>
```

2. Uncomment the listener for spring security in the [web.xml](/java/espm-cloud-web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml) 

```

        <listener>
		<listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
	</listener>
	<context-param>
		<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
		<param-value>/WEB-INF/spring-security.xml</param-value>
	</context-param>
	<filter>
		<filter-name>springSecurityFilterChain</filter-name>
		<filter-class>org.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy</filter-class>
	</filter>
	<filter-mapping>
		<filter-name>springSecurityFilterChain</filter-name>
		<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
	</filter-mapping>
```

# Building MTAR

In your CLI in the ESPM-CF project root folder run the command: 

	java -jar mta.jar --build-target=CF --mtar=espm-cf.mtar build
	
# Deploy MTAR

To Deploy MTAR, run the command:

	cf deploy espm-cf.mtar

In case if MTA Plugin is missing, you can download from https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud
